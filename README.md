# Overview
This project implements Naive Bayes and Perceptron classifiers from scratch in Python to classify:

Handwritten Digits (0–9)

Faces in edge-processed images

The goal is to explore feature extraction, custom algorithm implementation, and performance evaluation using different training set sizes.

## Features
Naive Bayes Classifier – Probabilistic model for pixel-based feature classification.

Perceptron Classifier – Linear classifier with weight updates based on misclassifications.

Custom Feature Extraction – Binary pixel features and grid-based segmentation options.

Performance Analysis – Standard deviation, and training time for datasets from 10% to 100% size.

## Technologies Used
Python 3

NumPy – Array operations

Matplotlib – Plotting learning curves and results

## How to Run
### 1. Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/mjakoto/Naive-Bayes-and-Perceptron-Classifiers-for-Image-Classification.git  

cd Naive-Bayes-and-Perceptron-Classifiers-for-Image-Classification
### 2. Ensure Python 3 & dependencies are installed

pip install numpy matplotlib
### 3. Run the main script

python main.py
### 4. View results

Accuracy, training time, and standard deviation will print to the console.
